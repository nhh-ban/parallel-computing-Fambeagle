I dont understand anything with the sources thing and im getting all sorts of erros when i try and implement code with that 
im just gonna do it manual i cant do it with source , and i dont understand how it is implemented with github at all
i will also note that in order to calculate the timer.r solutions you need to run the code of the problem 2 solutions first then
you can run the timer.r solution scripts.
